# Ecological distance - a quantitative measure of difference between "Nature in Norway" types

This repository contains spreadsheets with measures of ecological distance between NiN types, as well as scripts and source files for reproducing the calculations. 

This measure of Ecological distance is based on the structure of the ["Nature in Norway" (version 2)]( https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13164) system. The method further develops the concept and estimation og ecological distance from [Eriksen et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1127/phyto/2018/0293).

Ecological distance is a useful measure for assessing differences between e.g. two maps of the same area.
